OrchestrAIFramework - Conductor Module

The Conductor is the central manager of the OrchestrAIFramework.
It coordinates all orchestral sections (Strings, Brass, Woodwinds, Percussion, etc.)
by handling registration, configuration, and communication among them.

Each section acts as a specialized AI unit, and the Conductor ensures that
all modules play together in harmony â€” like a real orchestra.
